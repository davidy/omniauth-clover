# Omniauth::Clover

Clover OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth.

Supports the OAuth 2.0 server-side and client-side flows. For more information: https://www.clover.com/docs/oauth


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-clover'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-clover

## Usage

Integrates with Devise authentication:

1) add to your config/initializers/devise.rb

    config.omniauth :clover, "APP_ID", "APP_SECRET"

client_options: (optional)
- site: defaults to the production https://www.clover.com
- authorize_url: defaults to '/oauth/authorize'
- token_url: defaults to '/oauth/token'

example:

    config.omniauth :clover, "APP_ID", "APP_SECRET", :client_options => {:site => 'https://dev.server.com'}

2) make your user model omniauthable

    `devise :omniauthable, :omniauth_providers => [:clover]`
    
3) once your user model is omniauthable and if your devise_for :user was added to config/routes.rb, you will have the following routes available:

  ```ruby
    user_omniauth_authorize_path(provider)
    user_omniauth_callback_path(provider)
  ```
    
4) create sign in link

  ```erb
    <%= link_to "Sign in with Clover", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:clover) %> 
  ```
5) callback

  ```ruby
    class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
        def clover
            # @omniauth will have the following json available:
            # 
            # {
            #   "provider"=>"clover", 
            #   "uid" => "", 
            #   "info" => {
            #       "name" => "", "first_name"=> "", "last_name"=>"", "email"=>"", "role"=>"", 
            #       "urls" => {
            #       "Clover"=>"https://..."}
            #   }, 
            #   "credentials" => {"token"=>"", "expires"=>false}, 
            #   "extra" => {"merchant_id"=>"", "employee_id"=>"", "client_id"=>"", "code"=>""}
            # }
            @omniauth = request.env['omniauth.auth'].to_hash

            ...
        end
    end
  ```
